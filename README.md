# react-boilerplate

This is my personal React boilerplate

## Instructions

### Develop Locally

```
npm install
npm start
```

The app will open by default on <http://localhost:3000>. This can be changed in `webpack.dev.js`.

The page will automatically reload upon any changes.

### Production Build

```
npm run build
```

This builds the app with `webpack` to the `dist` folder, ready for production.

The configuration for this build is set by `webpack.prod.js`.
